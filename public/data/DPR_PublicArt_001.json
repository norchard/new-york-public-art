Wishing wells were believed to grant requests by way of magical waters or deities residing within. Visitors of all ages are encouraged to speak a wish into the well. The words are translated into a video ripple inside, and an echo repeats the words back. Turning the well&rsquo;s crank activates video and microphone recordings, which are captured in a database inside the sculpture. The recordings will be curated and presented on a dedicated website, wishingwellnyc.org, bringing the artwork beyond the physical space of the park. </p>\r\n<p>The Dyckman Farmhouse, a Dutch Colonial style farmhouse built c. 1784, was opened as a museum in 1916. Today it is nestled in a small garden and is an extraordinary reminder of early Manhattan and important part of the diverse Inwood neighborhood. The original well has long been absent from the house, although a replacement well-head was constructed around 1915-1916 during the restoration of the farmhouse. This well-head was removed sometime in the 1980&rsquo;s and replaced by a simple wood platform.

    "description": "<p><em>Birdhouse Repo</em> reflects on the effects of a constantly growing population  alongside income disparities in one of the world&rsquo;s fastest moving cities. This  oversized birdhouse, which is boarded up and placed under foreclosure, sits in  the heart of a neighborhood that is one of the most historical and notable  examples of New York City&rsquo;s gentrification and the real estate bubble. Simply  put, the city has become so expensive that even the birds cannot afford to live  here. This work is Aaron Schaeter&rsquo;s first public sculpture exhibition. </p>\r\n<p>This exhibition is  presented by <a href=\"http://www.firststreetgreenpark.org/\">First Street Green</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>&ldquo;Hippo Ballerina,&rdquo; a copper tutu-clad bronze sculpture standing over 15 feet tall, by Danish artist Bj&oslash;rn Skaarup plants her sizable slippered feet across from Lincoln Center. Inspired by Degas&rsquo; &ldquo;Little Dancer Aged Fourteen&rdquo; and the dancing hippos of Walt Disney&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fantasia,&rdquo; &ldquo;Hippo Ballerina&rdquo; vividly illustrates the artist&rsquo;s ability to reinterpret subjects and themes found in ancient myths, art history, modern animation, and contemporary popular culture in playful ways that engage the viewer. This is Skaarup&rsquo;s first US public art installation.</p>\r\n<p>This exhibition is presented by <a href=\"http://www.cavaliergalleries.com/\">Cavalier Galleries</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p><em>Open House</em> transforms Doris C. Freedman Plaza into an open air ballroom where only scattered furniture and arches remain eight blocks south from the original mansion. It references one of the grandest Fifth Avenue interiors designed by Gilded Age architect Stanford White: the now&ndash;demolished William C. Whitney Ballroom.Glynn&rsquo;s lavish Louis XIV sofas, chairs, and footstools evoke the historic home, but with a twist&ndash;these objects feature sculpted additions and are cast in concrete, a populist material more commonly seen in modern architecture. With this revision, the artist invites the public to enjoy a previously exclusive interior space that is now open and accessible to all. </p>\r\n<p>This exhibition is presented by <a href=\"http://www.nycgovparks.org/exit%CE%91url=https%3A/www.publicartfund.org/\">Public Art Fund</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Henry Taylor is a painter known for his intimate depictions  of people, capturing a wide range of subjects that span from his close friends  and family, to strangers whose appearances strike him, to celebrities within  the African American community. His color&ndash;blocked compositions evoke compassion  and a sense of shared space, setting the viewer in close conversation with  those pictured.</p>\r\n<p>  For the High Line, Taylor presents a  new version of a self-portrait adapted specifically for its setting on the side  of a building at West 22nd Street. The work depicts the artist and a friend  &ldquo;blissed out,&rdquo; relaxing in a swimming pool at a friend&rsquo;s house in Palm Springs.  Reminiscent of David Hockney&rsquo;s paintings of Los Angeles swimming pools from the  1960s, <em>the floaters</em>, a title which references the eponymous  Detroit R&amp;B group, portrays the artist in a moment of pure,  leisurely happiness.</p><p>This exhibition is presented by <a href=\"http://art.thehighline.org/\">High Line Art</a>.</p>",
